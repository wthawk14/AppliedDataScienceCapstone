The problem of choosing the location of a coffee shop in the Toronto Neighborhood

week1

The description of the problem and a discussion of the background
Question: Which place is more appropriate to open a coffee shop in the Toronto Neighborhood? A coffee shop owner wants to open a new coffee shop in the Toronto Neighborhood. He needs to know where to choose and will have a higher probability of getting customers?

Background: First explain that everything is hypothetical. On a train, I had a communication with a coffee shop owner. I learned from the communication that the coffee shop owner wanted to expand his store in the Toronto Neighborhood, and he wanted to know which communities in Toronto are more suitable for opening coffee shops. Because the boss is more anxious and has no cost considerations, professional data such as passenger flow, regional economy, and regional population types cannot be obtained, and can only be analyzed with the help of Internet information.

The description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem
Data description: Considering the time and cost issues, I chose to obtain data from the Internet. The composition of the data is mainly divided into two parts:

Toronto Neighborhood information, which mainly includes community name and community Geo information.
Toronto Neighborhood place distribution information, the main information includes: the place belongs to the Neighborhood information, place type, place name
Problem-solving ideas: Through statistical analysis of the distribution of coffee shops in all communities in Toronto, we look for communities with relatively few coffee shops for selection. While selecting objects, it is also necessary to observe the actual number of shops in the community to avoid the validity of the calculated data in the real environment.
